    In March 2018, my boyfriend and I travelled to Poland and had two tickets to fly to Iceland from there as well. However, we did not have enough money for accommodation in Iceland and decided to stay in Poland for our spring break. We have even bought return flight tickets from Gdansk to Vilnius! We had also bought tickets to other cities in Poland to make our vacation more or less exciting. However, the last second we got a notification that one Icelandic man offered to host us for free, so we packed our suitcases and left for Iceland with €10 in our pockets! Nevertheless, the trip was amazing and we even got to hitchhike to Reykjavik and see Northern lights!</p></div>

         Norway was my first Couchsurfing experience. However, my friends and I got to meet a nice local man who even gave us his keys to the apartment. We walked around all Olso and explored every piece of this city! We were also shocked by the price of everything there, especially burgers, which, by the way, cost around €23 in a local cafe in Oslo! Furthermore, in the evening we even had a chance to go to the birthday party of one American girl who we had never seen before. Norway was definitely one of the most unforgettable experiences!</p>
